go back and use memcmp to compare all unsigned char arrays (i.e. ip6, etc)
thread the server
	recvfrom -> copy details (si_other, buf, etc) and handle in threadpool
thread wain et al

can we possibly put the in-memory structure in another program? if so, then we could stagger the server program and the memory program, which would allow us to change where the memory is run from without causing a disruption in service... i.e. start another memory program, wait for it to load up (copied from current memory program?), stop the server, and repoint the server to the new memory program... this might be a bad idea... but maybe a variation could help?
